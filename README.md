## Interacting with apis

1.  This app interacts with three different apis to retrieve either songs, movies or concerts/performances the user is interested in.

2.  This app helps the user find out where and when artist/band are performing and can provide relevant information about movies/songs the user might want to find more about.

3.  This is a user driven app, to obtain results the user needs to input the name of a movie, artist, song or band for the app to retrieve the requested information.

4.  I am the only one mantaining this app at the moment; if you would like more information you can contact me at marino.carranza@gmail.com.

Please scroll down to see a few examples of how this app works;  Thanks!

## **Search**
The user can look for a movie or group, by typing in the terminal *node* followed by either
 'movie-this' or 'concert-this' (depending on the user's choice), followed by the name of what the user is looking for.


# **Looking for a song**
The user can look for a song, by typing in the terminal *node* followed by either *spotify-this-song* followed by *name of the song to search*
