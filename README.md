interacting with apis to retrieve information

1)  This app interacts with three different apis to retrieve either songs, movies or concerts/performances the user is interested in.

2)  This app helps the user find out where and when artist/band are performing and can provide relevant information about movies/songs the user might want to find more about.

3)  This is a user driven app, to obtain results the user needs to input the name of a movie, artist, song or band for the app to retrieve the requested information.

4)  I am the only one mantaining this app at the moment; if you would like more information you can contact me at marino.carranza@gmail.com.

Please scroll down to see a few examples of how this app works;  Thanks!
